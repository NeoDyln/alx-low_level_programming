# About #
- This directory contains C programs about variables and how they are used in various loops like fi, if else and while.

## Mandatory tasks ##

### 0-positive_or_negative.c ###
- This program generates a random number using the rand function and for each number generated, we check whether it is positive, negative or 0 using if statements

### 1-last_digit.c ###
- This program seems to check if a number's last digit i.e if it were an array it would be array[len] or simply the number taking the ones place value. I tchecks if that number is greater than 5 or if (less than 6 and not 0) or if its a zero and output some text based on the result

### 2-print_alphabet.c ###
- Here we simply print out the alphabet characters in lowercase. There's a trick to it tho.
- We are only permitted to use putchar twice therefore one use case has to be a loop through the letters while the other is for the break line
- We make use of the for loop like so
