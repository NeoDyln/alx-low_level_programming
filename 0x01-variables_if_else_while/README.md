## Mandatory tasks ##

### 0-positive_or_negative.c ###
- This program generates a random number using the rand function and for each number generated, we check whether it is positive, negative or 0 using if statements

### 1-last_digit.c ###
- This program seems to check if a number's last digit i.e if it were an array it would be array[len] or simply the number taking the ones place value. I tchecks if that number is greater than 5 or if (less than 6 and not 0) or if its a zero and output some text based on the result
