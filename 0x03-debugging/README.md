# About #
- This file contains a guide on the debugging steps I used as below

## main.h ##
- This file contains basic headers and function prototypes we use
- Headers are like stdio.h or string.h while a function prototype is basically a summarized form of a function that states its: return_type function_name(parameter(s)_and_type(s))
- I started it with an if statement that checks whether it exists and if not, it defines the main.h file
