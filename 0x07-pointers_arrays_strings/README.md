# About
- This folder contains more code on c pointers, arrays and strings

### main.h
- A file containing function prototypes

## Mandatory Tasks
### 0-memset.c
- This function adds a constant byte b,  n times in the passed storage/memory address s
- Requires adequate knowledge of pointers 
- Uses te concept of array decaying and accessing elements of an array using the array decay (Refer to the repo: alx-c-pointers-arrays-strings-notes)
- Remember char types occupy 1 byte of memory hence the increment by 1

### 1-memcpy
- This function is much similar to the one above only that we are copying elements from another array into a new one.
- In the previous one, we were simply editing elements at specific byte locations i the same array with a value given

### 2-strchr.c
- This function locates a character in a string passed and returns its memory address else returns NULL
